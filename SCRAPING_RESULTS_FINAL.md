## ‚ùå SITES REQUIRING ADVANCED TECHNIQUES (2/8 Sites)

### 7. Roadsurfer
- **Status**: ‚ùå NO DATA
- **Issue**: JavaScript-heavy SPA (Single Page Application)
- **Challenge**: Prices load dynamically after search form submission
- **Attempts Made**:
  - Static HTML scraping
  - Botasaurus with headless browser
  - Playwright with async form interaction
  - Cookie handling and modal dismissal
- **What's Needed**:
  - API request interception to capture booking API calls
  - Wait for specific React/Vue components to render
  - Network request monitoring with Playwright
- **Recommended Next Step**: Use Playwright's `route` API to intercept XHR/fetch requests

### 8. McRent
- **Status**: ‚ùå NO DATA
- **Issue**: Complex booking system with multi-step form
- **Challenge**: Requires station selection + date input + form submission
- **Attempts Made**:
  - Static HTML scraping
  - Interactive form automation with Playwright
  - Multiple URL variations tested
- **What's Needed**:
  - Proper form field identification (may use shadow DOM)
  - Wait for AJAX responses after form submission
  - Possible iframe or embedded widget handling
- **Recommended Next Step**: Use Playwright's `wait_for_response` to detect booking API calls

## üöÄ Recommendations for 100% Coverage

### For Roadsurfer:
```python
# Use Playwright's route interception
await page.route("**/api/search**", lambda route: route.continue_())
await page.on("response", lambda response:
    print(response.url) if "search" in response.url else None
)
```

### For McRent:
```python
# Wait for specific API endpoints
async with page.expect_response("**/availability**") as response_info:
    await search_button.click()
response = await response_info.value
data = await response.json()
```

### Alternative Approach:
- Monitor browser DevTools Network tab manually
- Identify the exact API endpoint used for pricing
- Build direct API scraper bypassing the UI entirely

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **Static scraping works for 75% of sites** - Simple price extraction from HTML is sufficient for most competitors
2. **Modern SPAs require different tactics** - React/Vue apps need JavaScript execution and API monitoring
3. **Multiple URL strategies are essential** - Having fallback URLs increased success rate significantly
4. **Cookie handling is critical** - All sites had cookie consent popups that needed handling
