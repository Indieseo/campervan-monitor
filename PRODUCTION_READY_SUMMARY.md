## ‚ö†Ô∏è **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**

### 1. **Price Extraction (1/5 = 20%)**

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs improvement (target: 80%)

**Working:**
- ‚úÖ Goboony: ‚Ç¨262.50/night (search sampling)

**Not Working:**
- ‚ùå Roadsurfer: ‚Ç¨0 (booking form found, price selectors don't match)
- ‚ùå McRent: ‚Ç¨0 (static extraction not finding prices)
- ‚ùå Yescapa: ‚Ç¨0 (search page not returning prices)
- ‚ùå Camperdays: ‚Ç¨0 (aggregator listings not being parsed)

**Root Cause:**
- Dynamic pricing pages require JavaScript interaction
- Price selectors need site-specific tuning
- Some sites may require API detection
- Booking flow simulation works but price extraction doesn't

**Fix Estimate:** 3-4 hours
- Manually inspect each site's booking flow
- Update price selectors to match actual HTML
- May need OCR or API detection for some sites

### 2. **Location Extraction (2/5 = 40%)**

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Improving (target: 80%)

**Working:**
- ‚úÖ Roadsurfer: 20 locations (excellent!)
- ‚úÖ Goboony: 2 locations (good)

**Not Working:**
- ‚ùå McRent: 0 locations
- ‚ùå Yescapa: 0 locations
- ‚ùå Camperdays: 0 locations

**Root Cause:**
- Site-specific HTML structures vary
- Selectors need per-site customization
- Some sites load locations dynamically

**Fix Estimate:** 2-3 hours
- Apply Roadsurfer's successful strategy to others
- Add site-specific selectors
- Test and validate

### 3. **Data Completeness (22.9% avg)**

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Below target (target: 60%+)

**Best:** Roadsurfer & Goboony (31.7%)
**Worst:** McRent & Camperdays (14.6%)

**Missing:**
- Insurance costs
- Cleaning fees
- Booking fees
- Seasonal pricing
- Policy details
- More locations

**Root Cause:**
- Need to visit more pages (insurance, FAQ, terms)
- Text pattern matching needs improvement
- Some data not on public pages

**Fix Estimate:** 3-4 hours
- Add 3-4 more page visits per scraper
- Enhance text pattern matching
- Extract from dedicated pages
