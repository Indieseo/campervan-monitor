### PHASE 6: AI & AUTOMATION (Month 6-8)

#### 6.1 AI Strategy Assistant

```python
class AIStrategyAssistant:
    """GPT-4 powered strategic advisor"""
    
    async def analyze_market_situation():
        """
        Input: All collected intelligence data
        
        AI Analysis:
        - Reads 200+ competitor data points
        - Analyzes 10,000+ reviews
        - Studies 90 days of price history
        - Reviews external factors (economy, seasonality)
        
        Output:
        "Market Analysis:
        
        Key Findings:
        1. Roadsurfer is testing a new pricing model in Germany
           (dynamic pricing with +15% peak rates). Early results
           show 8% revenue increase with 5% volume decrease.
           
        2. Goboony is expanding aggressively into Spain with
           -20% introductory pricing. This is a land-grab strategy
           that may pressure our Iberian margins.
           
        3. Customer sentiment analysis reveals growing demand for
           'eco-friendly' and 'pet-friendly' options. Competitors
           haven't addressed this gap yet.
        
        Strategic Recommendations:
        
        Priority 1 (CRITICAL - This Week):
        → Launch 'Eco Camper' fleet in top 5 cities
        → Expected impact: +€45K/month, 3% market share gain
        → Risk: LOW, Competition: NONE
        
        Priority 2 (HIGH - This Month):
        → Test dynamic pricing in Germany to match Roadsurfer
        → Run A/B test: 50% users see dynamic, 50% see static
        → Expected impact: +€120K/month if successful
        → Risk: MEDIUM (customer perception)
        
        Priority 3 (MEDIUM - This Quarter):
        → Defensive pricing in Spain to counter Goboony
        → Match their intro pricing for first 60 days
        → Expected impact: Prevent €80K/month loss
        → Risk: MEDIUM (margin compression)
        "

    async def natural_language_query():

        User: "Why is our Berlin market share declining?"
        
        AI: "Berlin market share declined from 24.5% to 21.8%
        over the past 30 days primarily due to:
        
        1. Roadsurfer's aggressive -15% discount campaign
           launched on Oct 1st (captured ~2% share)
        2. McRent fleet expansion (+45 new vehicles in Berlin)
           increased supply and lowered avg prices by 8%
        3. Our pricing remained static while market moved down
        
        Recommendation: Launch 'Berlin Fall Special' with -12%
        discount to recapture lost share. Estimated cost: €18K,
        estimated benefit: €52K revenue recovery over 60 days."

#### 6.2 Automated Scraper Generation

```python
class AutoScraperGenerator:

    async def auto_generate_scraper(competitor_url: str):
        """
        Process:

        3. Identifies pricing elements, booking flow
        4. Generates scraper code automatically
        5. Tests scraper
        6. Validates data quality
        7. Deploys to production
        
        Result:
        - 10 minutes instead of 2-4 hours per scraper
        - 80%+ success rate
        - Auto-maintains when sites change
        """
    
    async def self_healing_scrapers():
        """
        When scraper breaks:
        1. Detect failure pattern
        2. Re-analyze website structure
        3. Auto-generate fix
        4. Test new version
        5. Deploy if successful
        6. Alert humans only if auto-fix fails
        
        Impact: 90% of scraper breaks auto-fixed within 10 minutes
        ```
