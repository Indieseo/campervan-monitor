# Progress Update - October 12, 2025

## 🎯 Current Session Progress

### McRent - URLs Fixed ✅ (Partial Success)
**Before:** 14.6% completeness, all URLs pointing to mcrent.com (redirect page)  
**After:** 26.8% completeness, URLs corrected to mcrent.de  
**Improvement:** +12.2 percentage points

**What was fixed:**
- Changed domain from `www.mcrent.com` (redirect page) to `www.mcrent.de` (actual site)
- Pages now load successfully
- Completeness improved significantly

**What still needs work:**
- Price extraction not working (site requires booking simulation)
- Review extraction not working
- Locations not found (different page structure)
- **Recommendation:** McRent needs a custom scraping strategy, defer for now

### Next Target: Yescapa
**Current Status:** 24.4% complete, reviews working (4.8★, 363K reviews), prices missing  
**Strategy:** Debug search page, fix price extraction  
**Expected Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Expected Result:** Yescapa fully working (price + reviews)
