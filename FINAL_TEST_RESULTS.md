## 🔬 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. API Request Monitoring

**Feature:** Real-time network request interception

**Implementation:**
```python
# Monitor all API responses
page.on('response', handle_response)

# Extract prices from JSON recursively
def _extract_prices_from_json(self, data):
    if isinstance(data, dict):
        for key, value in data.items():
            if 'price' in key.lower():
                if isinstance(value, (int, float)):
                    prices.append(float(value))
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches AJAX-loaded prices
- Works with dynamic pricing
- Automatic JSON parsing

### 2. Multi-Page Scraping for Completeness

**Feature:** Visits multiple specialized pages per scraper

**Roadsurfer Example:**
```python
# Insurance pages
for url in [
    'https://roadsurfer.com/rv-rental/insurance/',
    'https://roadsurfer.com/insurance/',
    'https://roadsurfer.com/rv-rental/prices/#insurance'
]:
    await self.navigate_smart(page, url)
    await self._scrape_insurance_and_fees(page)

# Policy/FAQ pages
for url in [
    'https://roadsurfer.com/faq/',
    'https://roadsurfer.com/terms/',
    'https://roadsurfer.com/help/'
]:
    await self.navigate_smart(page, url)
    await self._scrape_policies(page)
```

**Benefits:**
- More comprehensive data
- Better completeness scores
- Finds hidden information

### 3. Site-Specific Location Extraction

**Feature:** Custom selectors per competitor

**Goboony Example:**
```python
async def _scrape_locations_goboony(self, page):
    location_selectors = [
        '[data-testid*="location"]',
        '[class*="city-filter"] option',
        'a[href*="/location/"]',
        '[class*="location-card"]',
        # ... 10+ selectors
    ]
```

**Results:**
- Goboony: 0 → 2 locations
- Roadsurfer: 1 → 20 locations
- Site-specific = better results

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

**Feature:** Timeout protection + detailed error tracking

**Implementation:**
```python
# Timeout per scraper
try:
    data = await asyncio.wait_for(scraper.scrape(), timeout=300.0)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    return {
        'success': False,
        'error': 'Timeout after 5 minutes'
    }
except Exception as e:
    traceback.print_exc()  # Full debugging
    return {
        'success': False,
        'error': str(e)
    }
```

**Benefits:**
- No hanging scrapers
- Better debugging
- Graceful failures

### 5. Booking Page Prioritization

**Feature:** Navigate to booking page instead of pricing info page

**Change:**
```python
# Before:
await self.navigate_smart(page, self.config['urls']['pricing'])

# After:
booking_url = self.config['urls'].get('booking') or self.config['urls'].get('pricing')
await self.navigate_smart(page, booking_url)
```

**Rationale:**
- Booking pages more likely to have interactive forms
- Better chance of price extraction
- Mirrors real user behavior

### 6. Recursive JSON Price Extraction

**Feature:** Deep extraction from nested API responses

**Implementation:**
```python
def _extract_prices_from_json(self, data, prices=None):
    if isinstance(data, dict):
        for key, value in data.items():
            if any(keyword in key.lower() for keyword in ['price', 'cost', 'total', 'amount']):
                if isinstance(value, (int, float)) and 10 <= value <= 10000:
                    prices.append(float(value))
            self._extract_prices_from_json(value, prices)
    elif isinstance(data, list):
        for item in data:
            self._extract_prices_from_json(item, prices)
```

**Benefits:**
- Handles complex nested JSON
- Filters reasonable price ranges
- Robust extraction

   - May need OCR or API detection

2. **Each Site Is Unique**
   - Generic approaches only get 40% success
   - Site-specific tuning essential
   - Trade-off: development time vs accuracy

3. **Data Scattered Across Pages**
   - Insurance on separate page
   - Policies in FAQ/Terms
   - More pages = more completeness but slower

4. **Review Widgets Vary Widely**
   - Some use Trustpilot, some Schema.org
   - Some have no reviews on site
   - Multi-strategy essential

5. **P2P vs Traditional Different**
   - P2P: Search sampling works great (Goboony)
