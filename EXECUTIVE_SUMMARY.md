## üí° CORE TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS

### Problem 1: Price Extraction Returns ‚Ç¨0
**Root Cause:** Booking forms load dynamically, selectors don't match actual HTML

**Solution:**
```python
# Multi-strategy price extraction:
1. Monitor ALL API responses for pricing data
2. Detect and interact with booking triggers (20+ patterns)
3. Fill forms with multiple fallback strategies
4. Extract from booking results, API responses, JSON-LD, meta tags
5. Validate extracted prices (30-400 EUR range)
```

**Code:** See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` Section 1

### Problem 2: Review Extraction Returns None
**Root Cause:** Reviews not on pricing pages, widgets load asynchronously

**Solution:**
```python
# Multi-page review search:
1. Check current page (multiple widget types)
2. Navigate to homepage (footer/header badges)
3. Parse JSON-LD structured data
4. Scrape Trustpilot directly as fallback
5. Check Google Reviews integration
```

**Code:** See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` Section 2

### Problem 3: System Fragile (No Error Handling)
**Root Cause:** Single failure kills entire scraping run

**Solution:**
```python
# Resilience patterns:
1. Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
2. Circuit breaker (prevent cascading failures)
3. Graceful degradation (return partial data)
4. Validation (ensure data quality before saving)
```

**Code:** See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` Section 3
