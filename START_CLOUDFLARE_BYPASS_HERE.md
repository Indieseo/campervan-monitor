```bash
# Run setup script
setup_cloudflare_bypass.bat

# Wait 5-10 minutes
# Will install everything automatically

# Then test
node test_cloudflare_bypass.js

# View results
start stealth-test.png
start apollo-test.png
```

## ‚ö° Power User Tips

### Tip 1: Parallel Execution
While Claude analyzes the PDF (4-6 hours), use that time to:
- Set up infrastructure
- Test basic functionality
- Experiment with Puppeteer
- Review existing code

### Tip 2: Incremental Testing
Don't wait for complete implementation:
- Test Browserless connection first
- Then add Puppeteer
- Then add stealth plugins
- Then test Cloudflare bypass
- Then migrate scrapers

### Tip 3: Use What Works
You already have a working Apollo scraper (Playwright):
- Keep it as fallback
- Migrate gradually
- Compare results
- Switch when confident

### Tip 4: Monitor Everything
From day 1:
- Log all bypass attempts
- Track success rates
- Measure timing
- Screenshot key moments
- Document issues
