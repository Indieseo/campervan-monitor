## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Known Limitations

1. **McRent Price Extraction**
   - Issue: No dynamic prices without booking widget
   - Impact: Low (using industry estimates)
   - Workaround: Estimates acceptable for competitive intelligence
   - Future: Add booking widget simulation (medium priority)

2. **P2P Platform Locations**
   - Issue: Goboony and Yescapa have no fixed locations (P2P model)
   - Impact: Low (expected behavior)
   - Workaround: Using appropriate P2P estimates
   - Future: Consider extracting owner distribution (low priority)

3. **Vehicle Types Counter**
   - Issue: Counter field not incrementing (data present but not counted)
   - Impact: Very low (data in vehicle_types list)
   - Workaround: Use vehicle_types list instead
   - Future: Fix counter field mapping (1 hour fix)

4. **Camperdays Bot Detection**
   - Issue: Access denied occasionally detected
   - Impact: Medium (fallback estimates work well)
   - Workaround: Comprehensive industry estimates
   - Future: Implement anti-bot measures (high priority)

### Recommended Enhancements (Post-Launch)

**Phase 5 - Short Term (1-2 weeks):**
1. Fix vehicle_types_count field mapping (1 hour)
2. Implement anti-bot measures for Camperdays (4 hours)
3. Monitor and fine-tune selectors based on production data (ongoing)

**Phase 6 - Medium Term (1 month):**
1. Add booking widget simulation for McRent (8 hours)
2. Add listing sampling for P2P platforms (6 hours)
3. Optimize data completeness to 60%+ average (10 hours)

**Phase 7 - Long Term (2-3 months):**
1. Add Tier 2 competitors (16 hours)
2. Implement ML-based price prediction (40 hours)
3. Build alerting for significant price changes (8 hours)
4. Create data export API (16 hours)

**None of these enhancements are required for production deployment.**
