## 🎓 How It Works

### Multi-Strategy Extraction

The system uses a hierarchical approach to maximize data quality:

1. **API Interception** (Highest reliability)
   - Monitors browser network requests
   - Captures pricing API calls
   - Extracts structured JSON data
   - Working on: Outdoorsy, Cruise America

2. **Booking Simulation** (High reliability)
   - Fills location and date fields
   - Submits search forms
   - Extracts results from listings
   - Universal form filler with 10+ patterns

3. **Text Extraction** (Medium reliability)
   - Parses page content
   - Pattern matching for prices/fees
   - Works on static sites
   - Working on: Roadsurfer, Goboony, RVshare

4. **Intelligent Estimates** (Fallback)
   - Industry-standard values
   - Business type aware (P2P vs Traditional)
   - Only when other methods fail

### Aggressive Field Completion

Custom enhancement module that ensures 90%+ completeness by:
- Extracting all possible fields from page text
- Applying industry-standard values when appropriate
- Using business type awareness (P2P, traditional, aggregator)
- Smart pattern matching for policies and features
