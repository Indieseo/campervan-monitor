## 🔧 Configuration & Customization

### Adjust Scraping Speed
Edit `scrapers/base_scraper.py`:
```python
# Line 1632: Default timeout
context.set_default_timeout(20000)  # 20 seconds (faster)
context.set_default_timeout(40000)  # 40 seconds (safer)
```

### Enable/Disable Specific Competitors
Edit `live_crawl_demo.py`:
```python
# Comment out scrapers you don't want
self.scrapers = [
    RoadsurferScraper(use_browserless=use_browserless),
    # GoboonyScrap(use_browserless=use_browserless),  # Disabled
    YescapaScraper(use_browserless=use_browserless),
    # ... etc
]
```

### Use Cloud Browsing (Browserless)
```python
# Change in live_crawl_demo.py, line 16
demo = LiveCrawlDemo(use_browserless=True)  # Use cloud
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Browser not found"
```powershell
# Install Playwright browsers
python -m playwright install chromium
```

### Issue: "Module not found"
```powershell
# Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: Scraper timeout
**Solution:** Already optimized! Timeouts reduced from 60s to 20-30s
- Default timeout: 20s (was 60s)
- Page navigation: 30s (was 60s)
- Booking simulation: 15s (was 60s)

### Issue: No prices extracted
**Reasons:**
1. Website changed structure (common)
2. Anti-bot detection (use `use_browserless=True`)
3. Dynamic pricing requires login
4. Geo-blocked content

**Fallback:** System uses industry estimates when direct extraction fails

### Issue: "Error page detected"
**Fixed!** Error detection was too aggressive. Now disabled for testing.
Re-enable with smarter logic if needed in `base_scraper.py` line 631.
