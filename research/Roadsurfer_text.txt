Service Fee

We charge a one-time service fee starting at $175 in North America and at $115 in Europe. What is the service fee? There are many steps to make your fully-equipped roadsurfer RV rental ‚Äúready to go‚Äù from the standard production line to the rental handover. The provision fee is to ensure that you receive the best customer experience possible.

Pets

All roadsurfer rentals can be optionally booked as dog-friendly motorhome rentals. Once you have chosen your preferred vehicle, simply add the one-off dog fee starting at $149 in North America and at $115 in Europe to your booking.

Cleaning Fee

We do not want our customers to have to pay for additional cleaning costs. Our goal is to hand over an impeccable vehicle to every customer and for this reason we have to charge an additional fee in exceptional cases.

‚Üí You can find an overview of the additional cleaning fee criteria in our FAQs

Security Deposit

The currency and amount of the deposit depends on the local currency of the station where you pick up your roadsurfer:

USA (USD $): $850
Europe (‚Ç¨): 800‚Ç¨
Switzerland (CHF): 800 CHF
Sweden (SEK): 9.250 SEK
Canada (CAD $): $1.200
Norway (NOK): 10.000 NOK
UK (¬£): ¬£700
Winter Travel

Please note that all our RVs and motorhomes in Canada undergo ‚Äúhibernation‚Äù during the winter months (from November to March). This involves emptying or filling all boilers and pipes with antifreeze, including the camper‚Äôs water tanks. Consequently, water usage in the vehicles, such as from the fresh water tap, shower, or toilet, is unavailable during this period. To prevent vehicle damage, kindly ensure the water tank remains empty throughout your journey. Any damage resulting from failure to comply will incur charges.

One-Way Rentals in the US

In the United States, you can also book a one-way trip and return your camper to a different station within the country. For our one-way rental option we charge a one-time fee starting at $349.

Pick-Up & Return
Opening hours

You can collect or return your vehicle from Monday to Saturday. Unfortunately, we do not release or accept vehicles on Sundays and public holidays. You can choose the time you want to collect or return your vehicle during the booking process, or later in your customer account. We charge a small fee for early collection (before 2 PM) or late return (after 11 AM). This depends on the time you choose and the fee will be displayed in advance in the booking process. If you return your RV outside our business hours, you do so at your own risk. We accept no liability for any damage caused during this time.

Refuel before returning

Please fill up the fuel tank shortly before handing over your vehicle. In North America, depending on the model, it could be gasoline or diesel and DEF (Diesel Exhaust Fluid). In Europe, every vehicle requires diesel and AdBlue. Please check in advance the specific consumable fluids your model requires. Nearby filling stations can be found close to our stations. You can find an overview of gas stations nearby in our gas station overview. Failure to return the tank full will regrettably incur a service fee.
