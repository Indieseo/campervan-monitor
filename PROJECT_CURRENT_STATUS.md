## ‚ùå WHAT'S NOT WORKING

### Critical Issues üî¥

**1. Price Extraction (BLOCKING)**
- **Status:** ‚ùå Broken - Returns ‚Ç¨0 instead of real prices
- **Impact:** HIGH - Pricing is the most critical metric
- **Root Cause:** Booking form detection not working
- **Current:** `No booking form found, trying fallback`
- **Needs:** Selector debugging, may need different approach

**2. Review Extraction (HIGH)**
- **Status:** ‚ùå Not Finding Data
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Reviews important for credibility analysis
- **Root Cause:** Review widgets not on pricing/vehicles pages
- **Current:** `Could not extract customer reviews`
- **Needs:** Navigate to homepage/reviews page, or scrape Trustpilot directly

**3. Data Completeness Below Target (MEDIUM)**
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Only 31.7% (Target: 60%+)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Missing many important data points
- **Missing:** Insurance costs, fees, policies, most locations
- **Needs:** More page visits, better text pattern matching

## üéØ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate Priority (This Week)
1. **Debug booking form detection** (2-3 hours)
   - Inspect actual HTML on Roadsurfer.com
   - Update selectors to match real structure
   - Test different triggering approaches

2. **Fix review extraction** (1-2 hours)
   - Check homepage for review widgets
   - Or scrape Trustpilot directly
   - Test extraction

3. **Improve location scraping** (1 hour)
   - Debug why only 1 location found
   - Should find 20+ locations

### Medium Priority (Next Week)
4. **Improve completeness** (3-4 hours)
   - Visit insurance/FAQ pages
   - Extract fees and policies
   - Target 60%+ completeness

5. **Test other competitors** (2-3 hours)
   - Apply fixes to McRent, Goboony, Yescapa, Camperdays
   - Verify 4/5 scrapers working

## üõ†Ô∏è QUICK FIXES TO TRY

### Fix #1: Try Main Booking Page for Pricing
```python
# Instead of pricing info page, use actual booking page
await self.navigate_smart(page, 'https://roadsurfer.com/booking/')
# Then look for booking form there
```

### Fix #2: Get Reviews from Homepage
```python
# Navigate to homepage first
await self.navigate_smart(page, self.config['urls']['homepage'])
# Check footer for Trustpilot widget
trustpilot = await page.query_selector('.trustpilot-widget, [href*="trustpilot"]')
```

### Fix #3: Debug Location Extraction
```python
# Add logging to see what's being found
location_elements = await page.query_selector_all('.location')
logger.info(f"Found {len(location_elements)} elements")
for el in location_elements[:5]:
    text = await el.text_content()
    logger.info(f"Location: {text}")
```
