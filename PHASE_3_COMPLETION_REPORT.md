## Known Limitations

### 1. Data Completeness: 52.4% vs 60% Target
**Status:** 87% of target achieved

**Reasons:**
- Some fields require additional selector refinement
- Competitor-specific customization needed for certain fields
- Some data not publicly available on websites

**Recommendation:**
- Continue refining selectors through production use
- Add competitor-specific extraction logic
- Target is achievable with minor tuning

### 2. Review Count: None Detected
**Status:** Review rating extracted, but count not found

**Reasons:**
- Review count may be in different location than rating
- May require separate selector for count
- Some sites may not display count prominently

**Recommendation:**
- Add additional selectors specifically for review count
- Check structured data for review count
- Consider this a minor enhancement for future

### 3. Single Competitor Tested
**Status:** Only Roadsurfer fully tested

**Reasons:**
- Test focus was on validating core functionality
- All competitors share same enhanced base code
- Time constraint for comprehensive testing

**Recommendation:**
- Phase 4 should include testing all 5 Tier 1 competitors
- Expect similar success rates across competitors
- Minor competitor-specific adjustments may be needed
