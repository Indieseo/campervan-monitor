# üîß DASHBOARD SCREENSHOT SORTING FIX

## ‚úÖ **PROBLEM SOLVED**

**Issue:** Dashboard was showing older screenshots (October 11th) instead of the most recent ones from today (October 15th).

**Root Cause:** The dashboard wasn't properly sorting screenshots within each company group by modification time.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **FIXES APPLIED**

### **1. Company Group Sorting** 
```python
# Sort screenshots within each company group by modification time (newest first)
for company in screenshots_by_company:
    screenshots_by_company[company].sort(key=lambda x: x.stat().st_mtime, reverse=True)
```

### **2. Company Display Order**
```python
# Sort companies by their latest screenshot time (newest first)
if selected_company == "All Competitors":
    companies_to_show = sorted(companies_to_show, 
                             key=lambda c: screenshots_by_company[c][0].stat().st_mtime, 
                             reverse=True)
```

### **3. Timeline View Sorting**
```python
# Re-sort filtered screenshots by newest first
screenshots_to_show.sort(key=lambda x: x.stat().st_mtime, reverse=True)
```

### **4. Enhanced Metrics Display**
```python
# Show full timestamp with date
st.metric("Latest Capture", latest_time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
```

## üéØ **WHAT YOU'LL NOW SEE**

### **Latest Screenshots First:**
