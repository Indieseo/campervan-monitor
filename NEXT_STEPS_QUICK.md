# Next Steps - Quick Reference

**Status:** 2/5 scrapers working for price, 3/5 for reviews ✓

---

## 🚨 FIX THESE FIRST (Critical Issues)

### 1. McRent - Broken URLs (30 minutes) 🔴
**Problem:** All URLs point to homepage  
**Fix:** Research actual URLs and update `scrapers/competitor_config.py` lines 64-69  
**Impact:** Will likely get price extraction working immediately

### 2. Yescapa - No Prices (1-2 hours) 🟠
**Problem:** Reviews work but price extraction fails  
**Fix:** Debug search page, increase wait times, better selectors  
**File:** `scrapers/tier1_scrapers.py` lines 960-1009

### 3. Camperdays - No Data (2-3 hours) 🟠
**Problem:** Search returns 0 listings  
**Fix:** Debug dynamic loading, verify selectors  
**File:** `scrapers/tier1_scrapers.py` lines 1102-1148

**Total Time:** 3.5-5.5 hours to fix all broken scrapers

---

## ✅ THEN ENHANCE THESE (Working but Low Completeness)

### 4. Roadsurfer - Push to 60% (1-2 hours) 🟡
**Current:** 34.1% complete  
**Action:** Visit more pages (terms, about, FAQ), extract policies  
**File:** `scrapers/tier1_scrapers.py` lines 27-122

### 5. Goboony - Push to 60% (1-2 hours) 🟡
**Current:** 31.7% complete  
**Action:** Extract commission %, better policy extraction  
**File:** `scrapers/tier1_scrapers.py` lines 808-940

**Total Time:** 2-4 hours to enhance working scrapers

## 📊 Expected Results After Fixes

### After Phase 1 (Fix Broken):
- **Scrapers working:** 5/5 (currently 5/5 but 3 have no data)
- **Price extraction:** 4-5/5 (currently 2/5) ← **MAIN GOAL**
- **Review extraction:** 4-5/5 (currently 3/5)
- **Time:** 4-6 hours

### After Phase 2 (Enhance):
- **Average completeness:** 40-50% (currently 24%)
- **Scrapers at 60%+:** 2/5 (Roadsurfer, Goboony)
- **Time:** +2-4 hours = 6-10 hours total
